# Tips - Tip Calculator app in Swift

This is an iOS app for calculating one's tip and total on any given bill amount, based on a tip of 18%, 20% or 22%. The app also lets you see the total amount split between 2, 3 and 4 friends.  

**Time spent**: 4 hours spent for basic app + 5 hours adding background gradient, redesigned layout, app icon, launch screen and adding functionality to see total amount split between multiple people.  

##Completed user stories:

User can type in Bill Amount and the tip and total will be calculated based on the tip percentage that the user selects (18%, 20% or 22%). In the likely chance that the user is dining with others, they can quickly see the total amount split between 2-4 people. 

**Notes**: I was playing around with adding a stepper or slider to let the user split the total amount between a greater number of people. I couldn't get quite it to work - I'm sure there's an easy solution that I could learn in the course :)
