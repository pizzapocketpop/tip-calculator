# Tips - The Tip Calculator app in Swift

This is an iOS app for calculating one's tip and total on any given bill amount, based on a tip of 18%, 20% or 22%. 

**Time spent**: 4 hours spent in total

##Completed user stories:

**Required**: User can type in Bill Amount and the tip and total will be calculated based on the tip percentage that the user selects (18%, 20% or 22%). 

**Notes**: This was fun! I'm going to play around with adding optional functionality. 

**Walkthrough of all user stories**:
